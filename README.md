# Plugin Start Script

## Overview
This script is designed to automate the creation of a WordPress plugin. It prompts the user for various details about the plugin, such as its name, description, version, author, and license. Based on the provided information, it generates the necessary directory structure and main plugin file with the appropriate headers.

## Current Features
- Prompts the user for plugin details with default values.
- Generates a unique plugin slug based on the plugin name.
- Creates a plugin directory and a main plugin file.
- Defines constants for plugin version and URL.

## Potential Improvements
1. **Input Validation**:
   - Ensure user inputs are valid (e.g., non-empty, valid characters).

2. **Logging**:
   - Implement logging to track actions performed by the script.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Add error handling to check if commands succeed.

4. **Configuration File**:
   - Allow for a configuration file to be used, so users can define default values without being prompted each time.

5. **Version Control Integration**:
   - Automatically initialize a Git repository in the plugin directory and create an initial commit with the generated files.

6. **Dependency Management**:
   - If the plugin requires specific PHP libraries or WordPress plugins, prompt the user to install them or include them in the generated plugin.

7. **Customizable Template Structure**:
   - Allow users to choose from different template structures (e.g., MVC, basic, advanced) that dictate how the plugin files are organized.

8. **Post-creation Actions**:
   - Offer options for actions to take after creation, such as opening the plugin directory in a code editor or providing a link to the plugin's documentation.

9. **Interactive Help**:
   - Include a help option that explains each prompt and provides examples of valid inputs.

10. **Support for Localization**:
    - Add support for localization by generating the necessary files for translation (e.g., `.pot` files).

11. **Testing Framework Setup**:
    - Optionally set up a testing framework (like PHPUnit) for the plugin, including sample test cases.

12. **Backup Functionality**:
    - Implement a backup feature that saves the current state of the script or the existing plugin files before making changes.

## Usage
To use this script, run it in a shell environment. Follow the prompts to enter the plugin details. The script will create the necessary directory and file structure for your new WordPress plugin.
